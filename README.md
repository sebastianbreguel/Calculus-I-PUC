# Calculus-I-PUC

This is a repository, that have all my teacher-assistan and my personal textbook of exercise, of the Course MAT1610 Calculus I at UC.

## content organization

The repository is organized in the following way:'

- `generals` contains the general content of the course, that are not related to any specific topic.
- `Teacher-assistant` contains the content of the teacher-assistant, that is the content that I have to teach to the students.

Then I have the following folders, that have the resume, the exercises, the solutions and my teachers assistans maded of the topics of the course:

- `Limits` contains the content of the limits topic.
- `Derivatives` contains the content of the derivatives topic.
- `Integrals` contains the content of the integrals topic.
