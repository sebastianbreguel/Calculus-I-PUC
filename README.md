# Calculus-I-PUC
This is a repository, that have all my TA and my personal textbook of Calculus/Analysis I  .

## content organization

The repository is organized in the following way:'

- `generals` contains textbook of excersis, the resume and the specification of the content covered in the course.
- `Teacher-assistant` contains the content of the teacher-assistant, that is the content that I have to teach to the students.

Then I have the following folders, that have the resume, the exercises, the solutions and my teachers assistans maded of the topics of the course:

- `Limits` contains the content of the limits topic.
- `Derivatives` contains the content of the derivatives topic.
- `Integrals` contains the content of the integrals topic.
